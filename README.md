**Dataset**
This dataset consists of 30,000 reviews for more than 200 different products. The reviews and ratings are given by more than 20,000 users.

The description of each column is provided in atrribute description CSV.

**Task 1**
Build an ML model to get the sentiments corresponding to the users' reviews and ratings for multiple products.

**Steps**
Exploratory data analysis
Data cleaning
Text preprocessing
Feature extraction
Training a text classification model

**Task 2**
Building a recommendation system

User-based recommendation system
Item-based recommendation system

**Task 3**
Recommend 20 products that a user is most likely to purchase based on the ratings.

**Task 4**
Improving the recommendations using the sentiment analysis model

Once you recommend 20 products to a particular user using the recommendation engine, you need to filter out the 5 best products based on the sentiments of the 20 recommended product reviews.

In this way, you will get an ML model (for sentiments) and the best-suited recommendation system.

**Task 5**
Deployment of this end to end project with a user interface using Flask and Heroku

Take any of the existing usernames as input.
Create a submit button to submit the username.
Once you press the submit button, it should recommend 5 products based on the entered username.
